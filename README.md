# bioinformatics
An old Java bioinformatics project about sequence matching and DFAs. This is meant to be an archive, hence the code will not be updated. Code is based on a Bioinformatics course from university. I'll look into it and see if I can find the original exercise problems, from a coursebook, that this code is an answer to.
